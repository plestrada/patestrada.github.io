# Welcome to my Github pages! I'm Pat Estrada.
I am a researcher and data analyst with a strong passion for data for good initiatives. As a firm believer in the transformative power of data, I have devoted my professional and personal pursuits to honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. On this platform, you will find a portfolio of my data science projects, each representing a unique challenge that I have tackled with the goal of producing top-quality solutions that drive real-world change.

It is my dream to share my knowledge and expertise in data science with a broader audience, with the goal of promoting data literacy and enabling individuals and organizations to leverage the power of data to make better decisions. I hope that my work will inspire and motivate others to join me on this mission to harness the full potential of data to create a better world.
